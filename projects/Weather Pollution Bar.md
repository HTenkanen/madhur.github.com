<sup>*Pollution is currently available in India only in select cities.</sup>

## Credits
The weather data is obtained from [OpenWeatherMap API](http://openweathermap.org/api)
The pollution data is obtained from [CPCB](http://cpcb.nic.in/)

I also looked to projects such as [Shuttle](https://github.com/fitztrev/shuttle) for direction on building status bar Cocoa apps.
